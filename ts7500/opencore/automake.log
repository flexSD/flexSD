 Note: 'No paths' indicates there are no paths in the design for that pair of clock edges.
       'Diff grp' indicates that paths exist but the starting clock and ending clock are in different clock groups.

Starting router resource preassignment
WARNING - par: The driver of primary clock net fpga_25mhz_pad_c is not placed on one of the PIO sites dedicated for primary clocks.  This primary clock will be routed to a H-spine through general routing resource or will be routed as a secondary clock and may suffer from excessive delay or skew.

Completed router resource preassignment. Real time: 17 secs 

Congestion Driven Router (CDR) is turned on.
CDR effort level is set at 0.
To turn CDR off, please set "-exp parCDR=0" on command line.

Starting iterative routing.

For each routing iteration the number inside the parenthesis is the
total time (in picoseconds) the design is failing the timing constraints.
For each routing iteration the router will attempt to reduce this number
until the number of routing iterations is completed or the value is 0
meaning the design setup analysis has met timing constraints.
